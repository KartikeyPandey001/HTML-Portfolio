      Based on a true story about a man named Christopher Gardner. Gardner has
      invested heavily in a device known as a "bone density scanner". He feels
      like he has it made selling these devices. However, they do not sell well
      as they are marginally better than x-ray at a much higher price. As
      Gardner works to make ends meet, his wife leaves him and he loses his
      apartment. Forced to live out in the streets with his son, Gardner
      continues to sell bone density scanners while concurrently taking on an
      unpaid internship as a stockbroker, with slim chances for advancement to a
      paid position. Before he can receive pay, he needs to outshine the
      competition through 6 months of training, and to sell his devices to stay
      afloat.
